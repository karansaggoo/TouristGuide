5. Location Helper: This file contains all the code related to the location. Home screen calls the function defined in this file to extract the location of the device. This file implements the fusedLocationProviderClient to extract the location of the user. When the user opens the app for the first time, a dialog box is opened to ask the user about the location permissions so that this app can use the current location of the device to fetch the data.

 
6. RetrofitInstance and IAPIResponse: These files are used to extract the data from the api. Retrofit is a third-party library used to fetch data from the APIs. Retrofit turns HTTP API into a Java or Kotlin interface. IAPIResponse file is an interface that defines the annotations on the interface methods and its parameters indicate how a request will be handled.
API: API is the acronym for application programming interface â€” a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations
 We are using google place API for this project. The Places API is a service that accepts HTTP requests for location data through a variety of methods. It returns formatted location data and imagery about establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest.
